### CPSC 120

* Lab 3
    
    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because I was very curious about Julian Day and how it worked. I was able to write a program for the first time to convert a given date to a Julian Day and take the difference between the two Julian Days to know the number of days existing between them. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was a favorite because I wanted to know how to write a program to calculate the average of numbers given as command-line arguments. I was able to a program that computed the arithmetic mean.

* Lab 9
    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because the story of the two philosophers had peaked my interest. I was able to write a program to test whether the eat-sleep schedule of the two philosophers represented by two strings could form a valid schedule or not.
